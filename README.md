FeXun is a visual novel creator that actually cares about you. No more deep-diving endless documentation, no more annoying compiler headaches, and no coding required. Simply fire up FeXun and get right to writing the next amazing story.

> All the heavy lifting is done by the amazing [Bevy Engine](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy), which powers all of the games you create with FeXun, and even FeXun itself.

## Before You Continue!

Please note that FeXun is currently nothing more than a hobby project for [me](https://github.com/kurimanju-dev) where I test different architectural approaches to see how each behaves and would suit FeXun best. I does not do anything yet. If you were looking for a visual novel game engine that's ready to use and battle-tested, I suggest [Ren'Py](https://github.com/renpy/renpy).
