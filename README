Introducing 'FeXun', formerly called 'Wave'
-------------------------------------------

FeXun is a visual novel engine written in Rust
that emphasizes performance, safety, and ease of use.

The name FeXun is derived from 'Fe',
the chemical symbol for iron, and 'Xun' (迅, xùn),
a Chinese term meaning 'swift' or 'fast'.

Our goal is to make FeXun a no-code engine geared
towards storytellers to create beautiful visual novels
quickly and efficiently. Using an intuitive interface
built with Dioxus, you'll never have to deal with
code or anything similar.

Utilizing the power of Rust, you can implement advanced
functionality not found in the engine by default.
Write your own WGSL shaders to further enhance your games.
FeXun will provide first-class support for
Windows, Linux, and Android, and second-class
support for the web as well as Apple platforms.

Here's a short breakdown of what FeXun is and is not:

FeXun is/will be...

...a standalone visual novel engine
...an alternative to engines like Ren'Py
...free and open source at all times

FeXun is not/will not be...

...a competitor to other engines like Ren'Py
...production ready until the first major release (1.0.0)
...able to create games other than visual novels

Note: FeXun's source is not ready for usage.
